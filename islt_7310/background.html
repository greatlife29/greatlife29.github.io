         Reece Services Group was a consulting, training and auditing firm. I built this firm ground up and used my previous knowledge to market and develop my business plan.  I worked with fortune 500 companies, primarily in the credit and banking industries, providing companies with an external source for auditing and training needs.  As the owner/operator I was available to provide knowledge and expertise to clients in auditing and training based on an initial audit review of processes and procedures as requested by the client. I have developed, published, and delivered over sixty-seven client specific training modules and trained over two-thousand individuals.  Some of these modules covered: 
                Customer Care (Be Here Now)
                Overcoming Objections
                Delivering on Promises

         Loss Prevention and Recovery (LP&R) was a consulting, training and auditing firm. I help build this dot com firm from the ground up. LP&R worked with fortune 500 companies, primarily in the credit, banking, and finance industries. We provided companies with an external source to assist companies with consulting, auditing and training needs.  I developed and oversaw the training and auditing divisions.  I worked closely with companies and employees to target resources in order to provide our clients a return on invested resources. This position taught me how to develop a company from ground up.  The company grew from four employees to one-thousand twenty employees in five years.
