We provided companies with an external source to assist companies with consulting, auditing and training needs.  I developed and oversaw the training and auditing divisions.  I worked closely with companies and employees to target resources in order to provide our clients a return on invested resources. This position taught me how to develop a company from ground up.  The company grew from four employees to one-thousand twenty employees in five years.
