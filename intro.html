 My name is Dennis Reece and I am a long distance learner living in Nashville, Tennessee. I have a Masterâ€™s in Education in Curriculum Design and Learning and Development. I work at UnitedHealthcare as an instructional designer from home. My background includes over fifteen years as an instructional designer and twenty years as a trainer. I look forward to using skills obtained in this course to apply to my training/design tool box in order to provide solutions. 
 What I would like to get out of this course would be a deeper understanding of web development skills and how that applies to instructional design.  I work with many websites and the knowledge obtained in this course should be beneficial to a deeper understand on how these sites work and process information. 
 In my spare time I enjoy golf, working out, and of course vacations.  I don't really have hobbies but do love cruising the open seas!
